You are awoken from your rest by a hubbub centred on the docks. Venturing outside, you can see that no less than three galleons are in the harbour, one putting to shore and the other two waiting for smaller ships to clear the quay. Looking at the ship putting to shore, it seems to be disgorging a company of Weimar troops, spearmen and archers, being screamed at by NCOs to disembark more quickly. The troops are forming up on the road, and then marching into Kislev, through the houses until they are out of sight, and all you can hear is the tramping of boots. This looks to be Weimar's response to the presumed loss of Jacobssen Ridge.



Clacks tower - if they still go there with new occupation of city - only two kenku here and one corpse. This tower does not seem well manned and these kenku are malnourished, manacled to the ground as they are. 

One of the Kenku is called Swishing Grass, the other Coins on Tin. One a country kenku, the other a city dweller. They are wary of the PCs but not scared, but recognise Flask - presumably his fame is spreading! If released, they advise that there has been a flurry of military communication over the last few days, ostensibly to do with the several hundred soldiers now arriving at the docks. 


Compound - they are passed a note by one of the guards, with directions to a hilltop a few miles away. 

'I moved the ship to avoid the Weimar bastards. Follow these directions to Morodin's Bluff. I'll be out of business soon, so I'll join you for one more trip. We'll cast off as soon as you get here.

Enryn'
