by Dosker Vo'seren against the wishes of the Elvish Council because of Thia's father's relationship with her mother. Convinced party to go to Altdorf to
parlay with Emperor Weimar whilst he did the same with the elves. Party helped him kill Onrek the Terrible, a flind who was terrorising the countryside

Ulf Darkwater - new "democratically elected" leader of the newly named Ulfsville. Was a sailor, burly man, habitually wears a black, stained bandana. Has
tattoos all up his forearms, one of them is of a naked lady. Protected the guardsmen from the baying mob in order to give them over to PCs. Their influence
had him elected as a popularity contest over George Mason, who was widely disliked and not respected. Spent his first night in charge drinking heavily, and
in the morning chose to send the two captured guardsmen back to Altdorf with a message that Ulfsville had seceded from the Empire and was now going to govern
itself. Took a BS ring, and agreed to send all official communications with it's seal thereafter. 

Took some Styggy with Tethir, but avoided addiction

The captured guardsmen - one "crabbed" (a favourite punishment of Ulf), both branded and sent back to Altdorf with George. 

Kenku - all released, sent to criminal contact in Port Viktor - tower then burned down. All communication stopped from Jacobssen Ridge outpost.
