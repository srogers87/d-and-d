WAR

Drow emerged from their homelands in the Underdark and attacked nearby human settlements
Boy-Emperor Tristan Weimar has demanded reparations from the elven rulers
	Encouraged to do so by his Prime Vizier Katarina Holic
High elf ruling caste refuse to disavow their drow brethren and have been drawn into a reluctant war to defend themselves against the threat of the humans

Human empire is held together by tenuous alliances which have been strained since Tristan Weimar came to power

Drow driven above ground by an invasion from below by the mind-flayers, seeking to extend their dominion of the ? plane

As a result of the war with their long-time allies the elves, panic levels are increasing within the Empire and racism against non-humans is becoming more and more frequent
Given the fragility of the infrastructure of the empire rumours abound as to how the war is going. You have heard that the Elves are winning, that the Empire is close to eradicating the elves,
the parties are locked in stalemate at the Elven border

All six of you arrested for spurious, half-formed offences, no trials just thrown in the cells
Group of mercenaries have been contracted to ferry supplies from Port Viktor to the Jacobsson Ridge outpost to the north
Territory is through some relatively dangerous terrain, so in order to visibly bulk out their forces the mercenary captain
essentially bought you from the local guards, who were only to happy to see the back of you

Lizardman, dragonborn, half-orc and firbolg chosen because they were massive
The mercenary captain found the kenku's impression of his sergeant hilarious
Wizard chosen because magic is rare and it looks impressive

Boy-Emperor Tristan Weimar

Power thrust upon him when his parents were (Karl and Natalia) were killed in a raider attack on their trade caravan
Karl was well-loved and was working to bring the Empire together via trade and mutual benefit
Since assuming power, Tristan has outlawed all trading outside the Empire and imposed huge levies on the movement of
goods within the territory itself. This has strained relations with the confederated nations and civil unrest has been growing

Prime Vizier Katarina Holic

Ostensibly the adviser to Tristan Weimar, and lives only to serve the Empire. In fact, is seeking a hostile takeover of
the Empire and is secretly moving pieces into place to achieve this
She has ordered that addition praise and worship of Takhisis within the Empire, enraging the church of Paladine who has been the major
religion in the area

Elven Steward Tassarion Dawnsea

Elderly even by elven standards, Ortuaré has only seen the drow emerge from the Underdark once before, when the primordial beings of (XXX) launched an
attack on their capital city of Menzoberranzan, when even the dark goddess Lolth was powerless to resist them

King Leroic

Drow king - fighting rearguard action whilst his people escape

Overarching story:

Character arcs - Vosker Do'seren killed Thia's parents, was leader of cartel who attacked the cartel enslaving Flask, could even have been the money lenders Curtis' 
father was wanted by. Now based in Altdorf, seat of human power - also there are Weimar, Holic etc

Ancient one Rhan-Tegoth is awakened from his slumber and seeks to manipluate the New World to destroy itself for his own entertainment.
To this end, he has convinced the god of tyranny Takhisis (the five-headed dragon) to assist him with (false?) promises of slaying the remainder of the Pantheon
and ruling equally with Rhan-Tegoth himself. Takhisis has sought to establish a foothold in the world by granting demi-god status to a select cabal of followers,
the first of which is Katarina Holic

+3 other champions, each with a relic around their neck (triangle, circle, square, cross) - can be placed on shrines at the elemental temple to summon Takhisis himself

Note: each temple of Takhisis destroyed/converted reduces his fighting ability

PLOT TWISE: Takhisis, whilst an Evil god, is the only one of the Pantheon to recognise the signs of the return of Rhan-Tegoth and has been trying to shore up the Old World's
defences. By defeating him, the players have unleashed Rhan-Tegoth upon the world!
