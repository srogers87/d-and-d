travelling is dangerous, not many people do it in these times, and certainly not without weapons or off the beaten track
idea is that the travelling itself is part of the fun
so travelling is the equivalent to a dungeon encounter, systems in
place for encounters etc but is random based on hostility of terrain,
length of travel, speed of travel etc

[travel mechanics]

combat - six second rule - I will set scene per character and once I've
stopped talking you have six seconds to begin to describe your move

mechanical things/unplanned effects can be discussed AFTER combat ends
idea is that you won't always make the right decision in combat, which is
accurate given how frantic this combat is - most fights are over in 3-4 rounds
which theoretically equates to 18-24 seconds

I HAVE to be harsh with this or it isn't a danger
so if I rule that you lose your turn don't hate me, be better next time

Take 10 mins to read your character sheets, ask me any questions now so you're
ready to pop off if a combat encounter presents itself
